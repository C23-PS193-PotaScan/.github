The carbohydrate content of potato plants is important to fulfill human food needs because carbohydrates are the main source of energy needed. As one of the tubers that can be used as a staple food to replace rice, potato production needs to be maintained in order to become a reliable food alternative for the people of Indonesia. However, during its growing period, potato plants are susceptible to various diseases that can reduce yields. Therefore, our project aims to develop an application that uses image processing technology and artificial intelligence to detect diseases in potato plants. The goal is to increase the production power of potato plants and maintain food availability for the needs of the community.

## Our Teams Member
this team come from 3 different path: Machhine Learning, Mobile Development, Cloud Computing with each path has a different task. our task from Cloud Computing is provide API for the data and connecting Machine Learning Division with the Mobile Development division. Machine learning path will create an algorithm to classify the types of diseases of potato plant leaves. Mobile Development path will makes an application interface for PotaScan.
